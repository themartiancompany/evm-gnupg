# Ethereum Virtual Machine GNU Privacy Guard (EVM GNUPG)

GNUPG wrapper compatible
with the
[*OpenPGP on Ethereum*](
  docs/openpgp-on-ethereum.md)
address specification
proposal by The Martian Company.

Keys generated by this program are used by the
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
to sign published recipes.

EVM GNUPG uses
[EVM Wallet](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-wallet)
to interface with wallets and it is a dependency for the
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
uncensorable Life and DogeOS user repository
and application store, which uses it to
generate a new Ethereum Virtual Machine
compatible network account's (an Ethereum wallet)
valid OpenPGP key, if not already present on the system.

EVM GNUPG is part of the EVM Toolchain.

## Installation

The program in this source repo
can be installed from source using GNU Make.

```bash
make \
  install
```

### Documentation

Upon installation, manual can be consulted by typing:

```bash
  man \
    evm-gnupg
```

Notes and other documentation are in the
[`docs`](
  docs)
source tree directory and installed onto the
`<data_dir>/doc/evmfs` directory.

You can consult the manual from an online mirror of this
repository. The `rst` source files are located in the `man`
directory.

## Installation

The program in this source repo
can be installed from source using GNU Make.

```bash
make \
  install
```

The program has been officially published on the
the uncensorable
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
user repository and application store as
`evm-gnupg`.
The source code is published on the
[Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
so it can't possibly be taken down.

To install it from there just type

```bash
ur \
  evm-gnupg
```

A censorable HTTP Github mirror of the recipe published there,
containing a full list of the software dependencies needed to run the
tools is hosted on
[evm-gnupg-ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-gnupg-ur).

Be aware the mirror could go offline any time as Github and more
in general all HTTP resources are inherently unstable and censorable.
